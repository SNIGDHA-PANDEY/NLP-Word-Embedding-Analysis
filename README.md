# NLP-Word-Embedding-Analysis

This repository serves as a deep dive into the intricacies of word embeddings within Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on the implementation and analysis of Word2Vec and GloVe models. It's designed to not only facilitate an understanding of word vector generation and manipulation but also to provide insights into how these vectors represent linguistic concepts.

**Objectives**:
- Grasp the foundational techniques of word vectorization.
- Visualize high-dimensional word vectors in a 2-dimensional space.
- Analyze and interpret the semantic (meaning-related) and syntactic (structure-related) relationships captured by these models.

**Contents**:
1. **Word2Vec Exploration**: Here, we train a Word2Vec model and visualize the resulting word vectors using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE, followed by an analysis of the emergent word clusters and relationships.
   
2. **GloVe Analysis**: This section utilizes pre-trained GloVe vectors to understand word relationships and explores analogies to demonstrate the model's semantic understanding.

3. **Comparative Study**: A detailed comparison between Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings is provided to evaluate how each model encapsulates semantic and syntactic relationships, illustrated with concrete examples of word pairs and groups.

This repository is structured to guide through the conceptual understanding as well as practical application and comparison of leading word embedding techniques in NLP.
